# Solar-Saver

## Description
   An Arduino Nano 3.0 based control circuit to turn a solar-powered IP camera on or off, 
   depending on battery- and light levels.

## Goals
   - Autonomous operation
   - Ultra-low power consumption

## Dependencies
   - Low-Power, a lightweight low power library for Arduino.
	 (https://github.com/rocketscream/Low-Power.git)
   - RunningAverage library for Arduino
     (https://github.com/RobTillaart/Arduino.git)

## Todo
   - Minimal EEPROM-based logging (min & max readings, state changes)
